# robocup-spl.github.io

The goal of this repository/website is to be an *up-to-date* and *actually helpful* resource for (current and prospective) RoboCup SPL teams.
Specifically, it should collect
- open-source software releases
- public datasets
- documentation about the NAO
- competition-related information (e.g. network infrastructure)
- league infrastructure information

Right now, the structure of this website is work in progress.
**You** can participate in shaping what this website becomes by creating pull requests or issues.
